# Introduction
Sentiment words are employed to compute the tendency of a sentence, and then a document. To detect sentiment words in Chinese documents, a Chinese sentiment dictionary is indispensable. However, a small dictionary may suffer from the problem of coverage. A method to learn sentiment words and their strengths from multiple resources is developed in this task.

# National Taiwan University Sentiment Dictionary (NTUSD)
First, two sets of sentiment words, General Inquirer1 (GI) and Chinese Network Sentiment Dictionary2 (CNSD), are col-lected. The former is in English and we translate those words into Chinese. The latter, whose sentiment words are collected from the Internet, is in Chinese. Table 1 shows the statistics of the revised dictionaries. Words from these two resources form the “seed vocabulary” in the opinion dictionary. These qualified seeds are collected in National Taiwan University Sentiment Dictionary (NTUSD).
